        <p>Welcome to <strong>Word MasterMind</strong>!</p>
        <p>
            Word Mastermind is a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind</a>,
            popularized by the game Wordle, but with a few differences.
        </p>
        <p>In Word Mastermind, you can choose any word length in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble">Scrabble</a> <a href="https://scrabble.merriam.com/">Dictionary</a></p>
        <p>
            Words available in the dictionary range from 2 letters to 15 letters. Playing a 2 letter game is probably too
            easy, but there seemed no reason to limit things.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike Wordle, the number of tries varies with the word length.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Attempt per letter in the secret word</li>
            <li>1 additional Attempt normally, or 2 additional Attempts if you've selected <b>Hard Mode</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Therefore, a 3 letter word will give you 4 attempts, a 5 letter will give you 6 like Wordle, and a bonus try
            for Hard Mode. A 15 letter word would give you 16 attempts.
        </p>
        <p>Guess the word the Mastermind has in mind in within the number of tries.</p>
        <p>Each guess must be a valid word of the correct length. Hit the enter button to submit.</p>
        <p>After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.</p>
